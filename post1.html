      <h1>My Founder's Story</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">By Ibrahim Mohammed Founder & CEO of AfrixaAI</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Ibrahim Mohammed</strong>, and I am the founder of <strong>AfrixaAI</strong>. 
        My story is one of persistence, rejection, resilience, and an unshakable belief 
        that Africa can build technology powerful enough to stand on the global stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a very young age, I was drawn to computers and technology. 
        While others saw me as “too obsessed” with my phone and system, 
        I knew I was sharpening my skills for a future I could already see in my mind. 
        People laughed, some even thought I was wasting my time but in my heart, 
        I knew those hours were building something much greater than myself.

      <h2>The Struggles That Shaped Me</h2>
      <p>
        Life didn't hand me an easy path. I faced rejection after rejection. 
        Loneliness and doubt became daily battles. At times, it felt like the world 
        was telling me to quit. But deep down, I realized that struggles were not signs to stop 
        they were lessons to grow. Each obstacle taught me patience, each failure gave me 
        wisdom, and each rejection built the persistence that fuels me today.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “Rejection is not the end; it is the universe asking you to come back stronger.”

      <h2>Why AfrixaAI Was Born</h2>
      <p>
        Through my experiences, I saw a painful truth: many African businesses are left behind 
        when it comes to digital transformation. While global companies enjoy AI-driven support, 
        automation, and powerful tools, many local entrepreneurs still struggle with 
        outdated systems and lack of access. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked myself: <em>Why should Africa always be the last to benefit from innovation?</em> 
        That question gave birth to <strong>AfrixaAI</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple yet powerful: to provide <em>world-class AI solutions 
        tailored for African businesses</em>. We are not here to copy others, 
        we are here to create solutions that fit our reality, our people, and our future. 
        AfrixaAI is about giving African businesses the power to scale, compete, 
        and thrive in a digital-first world.

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        AfrixaAI is more than just a company; it is a vision. A vision where 
        African businesses do not just survive, but truly thrive. Where a small startup 
        in Lagos, Nairobi, or Accra can use the same level of innovation as a company in 
        New York or London. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream is to see African entrepreneurs break limits, not because the world gave us 
        a chance, but because we built our own. AfrixaAI is my contribution to this vision 
        a promise that we can shape our own future with courage, persistence, and technology.
